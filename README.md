An exciting challenge, we are given data from the Kepler mission. Kepler was NASA's groundbreaking exoplanetary survey project that finally ended in 2018.
Kepler looked in the direction of the constellation Cyngus for evidence of exoplanets, that is, planets that orbit other stars. This is a highly difficult
challenge: without going to much into the maths, consider how faint distant stars are, and consider how much more massive they are than any other body in
their orbit. And yet, in the many years Kepler operated, Kepler found 2600 exoplanets, some of which have signs of being terrestrial planets. Kepler has 
paved the way for other projects, such as TESS.

Our task was to create a few models and see how well they do. It was a very open-ended project, but highly enjoyable. I decided to tackle this problem
with three models, and changing parameters to find the best results. The three models are:

-A logistical model that uses gridsearch,
-A SCV model, and
-A deep-learning model.
